# Spotify Data Visualization
Project carried out within the Data Visualization Techniques course for DS studies in Winter 2022/23 ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š

## About project
The project presents a dashboard in shinyapps.io based on data (about us) connected with activity on Spotify. To create it, we used the `R` language and packages such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `Shiny` and many others.

The app includes three tabs related to our favorite artists and songs, changes in preferences over time and analysis of song listening endings. Using interactive switches, you can change the person, select artists, albums and songs of interest.

### Application
